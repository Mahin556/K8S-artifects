We **can deploy multiple DaemonSets for the same kind of daemon**, and this is actually a **best practice in some scenarios** where hardware types, scheduling requirements, or runtime configurations differ.

* **DaemonSet Basics**

  * A DaemonSet ensures that a **copy of a pod runs on each node** (or on a subset of nodes based on `nodeSelector`, `affinity`, or `taints/tolerations`).
  * Commonly used for system daemons like **log collectors (Fluentd), monitoring agents (Prometheus Node Exporter), or networking components (CNI plugins)**.

* **Multiple DaemonSets for One Daemon**

  * Sometimes, you need the *same daemon* (e.g., Fluentd or a monitoring agent) but with **different configurations** depending on hardware, node pool, or workload type.
  * Instead of trying to overload a single DaemonSet with complex logic, you can define **separate DaemonSets**, each scoped to the right nodes.

* **Use Cases**

  1. **Different Resource Requirements**

     * Example: Nodes with GPUs may need higher memory/CPU allocations for monitoring agents.
     * Solution: One DaemonSet with `resources.requests` tailored for GPU nodes, another with lighter requests for standard nodes.

  2. **Different Configuration Flags**

     * Example: A logging agent needs to parse logs differently on database nodes vs application nodes.
     * Solution: Deploy two DaemonSets, each mounting different config files via ConfigMap.

  3. **Different Hardware Types**

     * Example: Bare-metal nodes vs virtual machines may need different system daemons or driver-related flags.
     * Solution: Use multiple DaemonSets with `nodeSelector` / `nodeAffinity` targeting the correct hardware labels.

  4. **Mixed Operating Systems / Architectures**

     * Example: A cluster with both Linux and Windows nodes.
     * Solution: One DaemonSet runs the daemon container built for Linux (`nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/os=linux`), another for Windows.

* **Implementation**

  * Use **labels and selectors** to scope each DaemonSet:

    ```yaml
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          nodeSelector:
            hardwareType: gpu
    ```
  * Alternatively, use **affinity rules** or **tolerations** for tainted node pools.

---

âœ… **Conclusion**
Yes, deploying multiple DaemonSets for one kind of daemon is a recommended approach when you:

* Need different **flags/configurations**.
* Require different **CPU/memory requests/limits**.
* Want to target different **node types** (by OS, hardware, labels, or taints).

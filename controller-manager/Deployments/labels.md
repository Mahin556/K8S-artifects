metadata:

  labels:
    app: my-app                 # Deployment-level label (optional, useful for grouping)
    environment: production

  selector:
    matchLabels:                # Selector defines which Pods this Deployment manages
      app: my-app

    metadata:
      labels:                   # Labels assigned to Pods created by this Deployment
        app: my-app
        tier: backend           # Must match selector above
        environment: production # Optional additional labels for clarity or filtering
    spec:
      containers:

```

- Deployment Labels (metadata.labels)
    - Useful for grouping, filtering, and organizing Deployments, e.g., with kubectl get deploy -l environment=production.

- Pod Labels (template.metadata.labels)
    - Apply to Pods created by the Deployment.
    - Used by Services, monitoring, and selectors.

- Selector (spec.selector.matchLabels)
    - Tells the Deployment which Pods it manages.
    - MUST match exactly the Pod labels in template.metadata.labels.
    - If they donâ€™t match, Deployment cannot manage Pods correctly, leading to orphaned Pods.

```bash
# Get all Pods with specific labels
kubectl get pods -l app=my-app,tier=backend

# Get all Deployments in production
kubectl get deploy -l environment=production
```

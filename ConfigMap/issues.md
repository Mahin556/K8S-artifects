Monitoring ConfigMap-Related Issues
    * Kubernetes doesnâ€™t automatically warn you if a Pod fails due to a missing or misconfigured ConfigMap.
    * Use observability tools like:
        * Groundcover, Prometheus, or Grafana
        * kubectl describe pod (for events)
        * kubectl logs (to debug startup failures)
    * They help detect issues such as:
        * Missing ConfigMaps
        * Crashed Pods due to bad configuration
        * Failed mounts or invalid references

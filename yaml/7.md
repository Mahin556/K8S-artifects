You explained YAML **documents** really well üëç Let me clean it up and expand a bit so it‚Äôs crystal clear:

---

### YAML Documents

* A **YAML file** is made up of **one or more documents**.
* Each document is **independent**, almost like having multiple YAML files in a single `.yaml` file.
* This is useful for configuration formats like **Kubernetes manifests**, **Ansible playbooks**, or **multi-resource configs** where you want several independent objects in one file.

---

### Key Points

* **Document Start** ‚Üí `---`

  * Marks the beginning of a new document.
* **Document End** ‚Üí `...` *(optional)*

  * Marks the end of a document without starting a new one.
  * Rarely used in practice ‚Äî usually only `---` is used.
* **Duplicate keys** are allowed across different documents but **not inside the same document**.

### Example: Multi-document YAML

```yaml
---
# document 1
codename: YAML
name: YAML ain't markup language
release: 2001
---
# document 2
uses:
  - configuration language
  - data persistence
  - internet messaging
  - cross-language data sharing
---
# document 3
company: spacelift
domain:
  - devops
  - devsecops

```

### Where You‚Äôll See This

* **Kubernetes**: Multiple resources (Pods, Services, Deployments) in one file.
* **Ansible**: Multiple playbooks or variable sets.
* **CI/CD**: Some pipelines accept multiple config docs in a single YAML.

üëâ Would you like me to also give you a **real Kubernetes example** (multi-document YAML with Deployment + Service + ConfigMap) so you see how this is used in practice?

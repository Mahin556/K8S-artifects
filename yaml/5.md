Perfect 👌 this is exactly the difference between `>+` and `>-`. Let’s see how YAML interprets both.

---

### Example 1: `>+` (folded, **keep** trailing newlines)

```yaml
message: >+
 This block line
 Will be interpreted as a single
 line with a newline character at the 
 end
```

**Resulting string value**:

```
"This block line Will be interpreted as a single line with a newline character at the end\n"
```

* Line breaks inside are folded into spaces.
* At the end, the `+` chomping indicator keeps the final newline (`\n`).

---

### Example 2: `>-` (folded, **strip** trailing newlines)

```yaml
message: >-
 This block line
 Will be interpreted as a single
 line without the newline character at the
 end
```

**Resulting string value**:

```
"This block line Will be interpreted as a single line without the newline character at the end"
```

* Line breaks inside are folded into spaces.
* At the end, the `-` chomping indicator removes the final newline — so no `\n`.

---

🔑 **Summary**:

* `>+` → **with** newline at the end.
* `>-` → **without** newline at the end.
* `>` (no sign) → default, keeps exactly **one** newline at the end.

---
Great 👍 Let’s compare **literal block scalars (`|`)** with the chomping indicators, using your same text.

---

### 1. `|` (literal, default → keep **one newline** at the end)

```yaml
message: |
 This block line
 Will be interpreted as multiple
 lines with preserved newlines
 at the end
```

**Resulting string value**:

```
"This block line\nWill be interpreted as multiple\nlines with preserved newlines\nat the end\n"
```

* Newlines inside are **preserved exactly**.
* Ends with **one `\n`**.

---

### 2. `|-` (literal, strip → remove all trailing newlines)

```yaml
message: |-
 This block line
 Will be interpreted as multiple
 lines with preserved newlines
 at the end
```

**Resulting string value**:

```
"This block line\nWill be interpreted as multiple\nlines with preserved newlines\nat the end"
```

* Newlines inside are preserved.
* The **final newline is removed** (no `\n`).

---

### 3. `|+` (literal, keep → preserve all trailing newlines)

```yaml
message: |+
 This block line
 Will be interpreted as multiple
 lines with preserved newlines
 at the end
```

**Resulting string value**:

```
"This block line\nWill be interpreted as multiple\nlines with preserved newlines\nat the end\n\n"
```

* Newlines inside are preserved.
* All **trailing newlines are kept** (so you get **two `\n` at the end** here).

---

🔑 **Main difference between `>` and `|`:**

* `>` = **folded** → turns newlines into spaces (except blank lines → kept as `\n`).
* `|` = **literal** → keeps newlines exactly as written.

---

Perfect 🚀 Let’s put all **six cases** side by side in a comparison table using your sample text.

✅ Quick rules to remember:

* `>` = folded → spaces inside.
* `|` = literal → preserve line breaks.
* `-` = strip final newline.
* `+` = keep all trailing newlines.
* (no sign) = keep exactly one trailing newline.

Do you want me to also make a **visual demo** (how the string looks when printed normally vs with `repr()`/escaped `\n`) so you can see the difference in real output?

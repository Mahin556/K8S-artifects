Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the **interesting facts about YAML** you shared, with some extra clarity:

* YAML is powerful but can be tricky because of its **schemas** (rules about how values are interpreted).

* YAMLâ€™s **core schema** has some built-in interpretations:

  * `null`, `NULL`, `~` â†’ all mean `null`.
  * `true`, `True`, `yes`, `on` â†’ all mean boolean `true`.
  * `false`, `False`, `no`, `off` â†’ all mean boolean `false`.

* This leads to the **Norway problem**:

  * Example YAML:

    ```yaml
    countries:
      - GB
      - IE
      - FR
      - DE
      - NO
    ```
  * In **Python** with `pyyaml`:

    ```python
    from yaml import load, SafeLoader
    config = load(yaml_text, Loader=SafeLoader)
    print(config)
    ```

    Output becomes:

    ```python
    {'countries': ['GB', 'IE', 'FR', 'DE', False]}
    ```

    Because YAML thinks `NO` = boolean **False**.

* **Solution** â†’ Quote values that might be misinterpreted:

  ```yaml
  countries:
    - GB
    - IE
    - FR
    - DE
    - "NO"
  ```

* **Better fix** â†’ Use libraries that parse more strictly:

  * **StrictYAML** â†’ treats everything as a string unless explicitly typed.
  * **SafeLoader** in PyYAML â†’ more secure and avoids some of these pitfalls.

* Other similar surprises:

  * `2025-09-16` might get parsed as a **date**, not a string.
  * `01` might get parsed as an **integer** `1`, losing the leading zero.
  * `1.0` could be treated as a float instead of a string.

ðŸ‘‰ Rule of thumb: **Always quote ambiguous values in YAML** if they look like keywords, numbers, or dates.

Do you want me to also give you a **list of all YAML keywords that can cause such parsing issues** (like `YES`, `ON`, `NULL`, etc.) so you know when to quote them?

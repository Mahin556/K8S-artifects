Perfect ðŸ‘Œ this is exactly the difference between `>+` and `>-`. Letâ€™s see how YAML interprets both.

---

### Example 1: `>+` (folded, **keep** trailing newlines)

```yaml
message: >+
 This block line
 Will be interpreted as a single
 line with a newline character at the 
 end
```

**Resulting string value**:

```
"This block line Will be interpreted as a single line with a newline character at the end\n"
```

* Line breaks inside are folded into spaces.
* At the end, the `+` chomping indicator keeps the final newline (`\n`).

---

### Example 2: `>-` (folded, **strip** trailing newlines)

```yaml
message: >-
 This block line
 Will be interpreted as a single
 line without the newline character at the
 end
```

**Resulting string value**:

```
"This block line Will be interpreted as a single line without the newline character at the end"
```

* Line breaks inside are folded into spaces.
* At the end, the `-` chomping indicator removes the final newline â€” so no `\n`.

---

ðŸ”‘ **Summary**:

* `>+` â†’ **with** newline at the end.
* `>-` â†’ **without** newline at the end.
* `>` (no sign) â†’ default, keeps exactly **one** newline at the end.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also show the difference between `|`, `|-`, and `|+` (literal block scalars) with the same text? Thatâ€™s often confusing too.

# **Kubernetes Static Pods**

## **1. What Are Static Pods?**

* **Normal Pods** are created by the Kubernetes API server when you apply manifests with `kubectl apply`.
* **Static Pods** are managed **directly by the kubelet** on a node, **without the API server or controllers**.
* Theyâ€™re defined by putting a **Pod manifest file** in a special directory on a node (default: `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`).

ðŸ‘‰ The kubelet watches this directory and ensures that each YAML file describes a Pod running on that node.

---

## **2. Key Features**

* **Bypass API Server** â†’ no need to `kubectl apply`.
* **Node-local only** â†’ kubelet manages them directly.
* **Auto-restart** â†’ if deleted manually, kubelet recreates them from the manifest.
* **Not scheduled by the scheduler** â†’ always runs on the node where the manifest exists.
* **Shown in `kubectl get pods`** â†’ they appear like normal pods but have a suffix:

  ```
  <pod-name>-<node-name>
  ```

---

## **3. Typical Use Cases**

* Bootstrapping Kubernetes itself:

  * `kube-apiserver`
  * `kube-controller-manager`
  * `kube-scheduler`
  * `etcd`
    (all run as **static pods** in kubeadm-based clusters)
* Running critical node-level agents (e.g., monitoring, logging).
* Useful in **single-node clusters** or debugging.

---

## **4. Example: Static Pod Manifest**

Place this file at `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/nginx-static.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-static
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.25
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

ðŸ‘‰ Once the file is saved:

* Kubelet detects it.
* Creates `nginx-static-<node-name>` Pod.
* You can verify:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -A | grep nginx-static
  ```

## **5. Static Pods vs Normal Pods**

| Feature    | Static Pod                                       | Normal Pod                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Created by | **kubelet** from file                            | **API server** via kubectl/controller |
| Managed by | kubelet only                                     | Full Kubernetes control plane         |
| Scheduling | Always runs on **local node**                    | Scheduler decides                     |
| Use Case   | Critical system components                       | Regular apps                          |
| Visibility | Appears in API server, but controlled by kubelet | Fully controlled by API server        |

---

## **6. Limitations**

* Cannot be controlled by higher-level controllers (Deployments, ReplicaSets, DaemonSets).
* Cannot be moved between nodes by scheduler.
* Harder to manage at scale (need to manually place YAMLs on each node).

---

âœ… **Summary**

* Static Pods = defined locally, managed by kubelet, not scheduler.
* Great for **bootstrapping Kubernetes components** and node-level agents.
* Appear in the cluster but are **node-bound** and **not API-driven**.

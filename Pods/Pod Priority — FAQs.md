## üß† **Kubernetes Pod Priority ‚Äî FAQs (Detailed Explanation)**

---

### **1. What is Kubernetes DaemonSet Priority?**

* **DaemonSets** behave just like normal Pods when it comes to priority.
* Every Pod created by a DaemonSet **inherits the PriorityClass** if you define one in its Pod template.
* During resource shortages on a node, **low-priority DaemonSet Pods can also be evicted** ‚Äî unless you explicitly give them a **higher PriorityClass**.

‚úÖ **Best Practice:**

* For important DaemonSets like:

  * `node-exporter` (monitoring)
  * `fluentd` or `filebeat` (logging)
  * `kube-proxy`
  * `csi-node` plugins
    ‚Üí assign a **high-priority class**, e.g. `system-node-critical` or a custom one.

üîπ **Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: node-logger
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      priorityClassName: high-priority
      containers:
        - name: logger
          image: fluentd
```

This ensures your logging DaemonSet Pods **stay stable** during node resource pressure.

### **2. How is Pod QoS Related to Pod Priority and Preemption?**

Both **QoS (Quality of Service)** and **Priority** influence **which Pods survive during resource shortages**, but they act at different stages and layers.

| Concept          | Handled By    | Trigger Condition                        | Decision Based On                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **QoS Eviction** | **Kubelet**   | Node-level resource crunch (memory, CPU) | QoS class (`Guaranteed`, `Burstable`, `BestEffort`) |
| **Preemption**   | **Scheduler** | When a **new Pod** cannot be scheduled   | Pod **priority value**                              |

üß© **QoS eviction** happens immediately on the **node**, regardless of scheduling queue.
üß© **Preemption** happens during **scheduling**, when the scheduler tries to make room for a high-priority Pod.

‚úÖ **Key point:**
During **preemption**, the scheduler **does not consider QoS**.
It only looks at **priority values** ‚Äî so even a low-QoS Pod with a high priority may stay.

---

### **3. What is the Significance of Pod Priority?**

Pod Priority lets you control **which workloads are protected** and **which can be sacrificed** when resources are tight.

Example use cases:

* üü¢ **Critical system workloads:** `metrics-server`, `coredns`, `kube-proxy`
* üü¢ **Important business apps:** `payment-service`, `api-gateway`, `logging agents`
* üîµ **Normal workloads:** frontend, test services
* ‚ö™ **Low-priority/batch jobs:** reports, analytics, etc.

During cluster overload:

* Kubelet **evicts lower-priority Pods**.
* Scheduler ensures **critical workloads** always get scheduled first.

‚úÖ **You can design a hierarchy like:**

| Tier             | Example Apps                    | Priority Value |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Mission-critical | Payment API, logging DaemonSets | 1000+          |
| Core services    | Frontend, user API              | 500            |
| Batch/analytics  | Reports, test apps              | 100            |

This ensures **important apps stay alive**, even under heavy load or resource competition.

---

### **4. What is the Effect of PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) on Preemption?**

* **PodDisruptionBudget (PDB)** defines how many Pods of a ReplicaSet or Deployment **must remain available** during disruptions.
* The scheduler **respects PDBs** *whenever possible* during preemption.

üß© **Example PDB:**

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: web-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
```

If a ReplicaSet has 3 Pods and `minAvailable: 2`, the scheduler will try to ensure at least **2 Pods stay running** during preemption.

‚úÖ **Normal Behavior:**

* Scheduler avoids evicting Pods that would violate the PDB.
* It looks for other Pods to preempt instead.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Exception (Important):**
If a **very high-priority Pod** needs to be scheduled and **no other option exists**,
Kubernetes **will still preempt Pods even if it breaks the PDB rule**.

This ensures that **critical workloads** (like control-plane components or payment systems) are always prioritized.

---

### **5. Why Should DevOps Engineers Understand Pod Priority?**

Because it‚Äôs crucial for:

* Designing **resilient production clusters**
* Managing **resource starvation scenarios**
* Ensuring **critical services stay available**
* Optimizing **multi-tenant clusters**

üß† **In Kubernetes certifications (CKA/CKS/CKAD)**:

* You must understand how `PriorityClass`, `preemptionPolicy`, and `PodDisruptionBudget` interact.
* Preemption behavior and YAML creation questions are frequently asked.

### **6. Summary ‚Äî Key Takeaways**

| Concept                | Description                          | Notes                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **PriorityClass**      | Defines numerical priority           | Cluster-scoped object             |
| **priorityClassName**  | Used in Pod spec                     | Refers to PriorityClass           |
| **Preemption**         | Evicts low-priority Pods             | Triggered by Scheduler            |
| **QoS Eviction**       | Node-level eviction                  | Triggered by Kubelet              |
| **DaemonSet Priority** | Set explicitly                       | Important for logging, monitoring |
| **PDB Effect**         | Scheduler respects, but can override | For very high-priority Pods       |

### ‚úÖ **Example: Protecting Critical Workloads**

```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: critical-services
value: 1000
description: "Priority for core infrastructure and monitoring pods"

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: node-logger
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: logger
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: logger
    spec:
      priorityClassName: critical-services
      containers:
        - name: fluentd
          image: fluentd
```

This ensures that your logging DaemonSet Pods **are never preempted or evicted** before other lower-priority Pods.

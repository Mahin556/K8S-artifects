## **Kubernetes LoadBalancer Service**

### ðŸ”¹ Why LoadBalancer is Needed

* Pods have **ephemeral IPs** (they change when Pods restart or are recreated).
* Services like **ClusterIP** and **NodePort** provide internal access or fixed node-level ports, but they are not ideal for external/public access.
* In real-world applications, we need to expose services to **users outside the cluster** (e.g., customers accessing a web app).
* **LoadBalancer Service** is designed for this purpose.

---

### ðŸ”¹ What LoadBalancer Does

* When you create a Service of type **LoadBalancer**, Kubernetes requests an **external load balancer** from the **cloud provider** (AWS ELB, GCP LB, Azure LB, etc.).
* The cloud provider assigns a **public IP** (or DNS) to the LoadBalancer.
* Traffic flow:

  1. User â†’ LoadBalancer Public IP
  2. LoadBalancer â†’ Service (ClusterIP)
  3. Service â†’ Pod Endpoints (load balancing across replicas)

### ðŸ”¹ Example: LoadBalancer YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-lb
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: sample-python-app
  ports:
    - port: 80        # Port exposed by Service (LB frontend port)
      targetPort: 8000 # Pod's container port
```

* **type: LoadBalancer** â†’ Requests external LB from cloud provider.
* **selector: app=sample-python-app** â†’ Matches Pods with that label.
* **port: 80** â†’ External users access via HTTP `:80`.
* **targetPort: 8000** â†’ Actual port where application container listens.

### ðŸ”¹ LoadBalancer vs NodePort

| Feature              | NodePort                                                   | LoadBalancer                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access**           | Exposes app on all Node IPs at a static port (30000â€“32767) | Exposes app on a public IP from cloud provider                            |
| **Ease of Use**      | Requires knowing Node IP and NodePort                      | Users simply access via public IP/DNS                                     |
| **Cloud Dependency** | Works on any Kubernetes cluster                            | Works only on cloud providers (or with tools like MetalLB for bare metal) |
| **Scalability**      | Manual scaling (requires node IP mgmt)                     | Scales automatically with cloud LB features                               |
| **Best For**         | Local development, testing                                 | Production, external users                                                |

### ðŸ”¹ Key Points

* **Public IP allocation** happens only in cloud environments.
* On **bare metal clusters**, LoadBalancer wonâ€™t work unless you install an external LB solution (e.g., **MetalLB**).
* **Labels must match**:

  * Deployment Pod labels â†’ Service selector.
  * If labels mismatch, the Service wonâ€™t find Pods (no Endpoints).
* **Service provides load balancing, not Deployment**:

  * Deployment only manages Pods and replicas.
  * Service load balances traffic across healthy Pods.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example Flow

1. **Deployment**:

   * Runs 2 replicas of `sample-python-app` Pods.
   * Each Pod listens on port **8000**.
2. **Service (LoadBalancer)**:

   * Exposes app on **port 80** (public IP from cloud).
   * Routes requests â†’ Pod endpoints.
3. **User Access**:

   * User hits: `http://<public-loadbalancer-ip>/`
   * Request â†’ Cloud Load Balancer â†’ Kubernetes Service â†’ Pods.

### ðŸ”¹ Service Inspection

Check the Service:

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

Output:

```
NAME             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
my-app-lb        LoadBalancer   10.96.50.200   35.223.14.120   80:30555/TCP   2m
```

* **CLUSTER-IP** â†’ Internal IP (inside cluster).
* **EXTERNAL-IP** â†’ Public IP (from cloud LB).
* **PORT(S)** â†’ Maps external port 80 â†’ Pod port 8000.

Check Endpoints:

```bash
kubectl get ep
```

```
NAME         ENDPOINTS                       AGE
my-app-lb    10.244.1.3:8000,10.244.2.4:8000 2m
```

* Shows actual Pod IPs where traffic is redirected.

### ðŸ”¹ Benefits of LoadBalancer Service

* Provides a **stable external entry point** (public IP / DNS).
* Automatically **load balances** across multiple Pods.
* Integrates with **cloud-native features** (health checks, SSL termination, firewall rules).
* Makes apps **production-ready** for real users.

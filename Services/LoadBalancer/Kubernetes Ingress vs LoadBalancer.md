Hereâ€™s a **detailed breakdown of Kubernetes Ingress vs LoadBalancer** in a clear comparison format:

| Feature                 | **Ingress**                                                            | **LoadBalancer**                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OSI Layer**           | Layer 7 (Application â€“ HTTP/HTTPS)                                     | Layer 4 (Network â€“ TCP/UDP)                                            |
| **Primary Use Case**    | Centralized routing for multiple services (path/host-based)            | Directly expose a single service externally                            |
| **External IPs**        | All services share **one external IP** (via ingress controller)        | Each service gets a **separate external IP**                           |
| **Traffic Routing**     | Smart routing based on **domain, path, headers, SSL**                  | Simple port-based routing to service pods                              |
| **SSL/TLS Support**     | Supports **SSL termination** and certificate management                | No SSL handling, traffic passes as-is                                  |
| **Cost Efficiency**     | Cost-effective (one LB IP for many services)                           | Can become expensive (one LB IP per service)                           |
| **Flexibility**         | Can rewrite URLs, add headers, perform redirects                       | No content-level control                                               |
| **Scaling**             | Works well for **many microservices** with one entry point             | Works best for a **small number of services**                          |
| **Session Persistence** | Can be configured (sticky sessions via ingress annotations)            | Supports provider-level session affinity                               |
| **Implementation**      | Requires **Ingress Controller** (NGINX, Traefik, Istio, HAProxy, etc.) | Provided directly by cloud provider LB (AWS ELB/NLB, Azure LB, GCP LB) |
| **Example Use Case**    | Hosting multiple apps under `app1.example.com`, `app2.example.com`     | Exposing a single database or API service directly to external clients |

ðŸ”‘ **When to use what?**

* âœ… Use **LoadBalancer**: If you just need to expose **one or a few services externally** with minimal configuration (e.g., database, legacy apps).
* âœ… Use **Ingress**: If you need **centralized HTTP/HTTPS routing** for many microservices, SSL termination, or path/domain-based routing.

ðŸ‘‰ Many production setups actually **combine both**:

* A **cloud LoadBalancer** fronts the cluster (L4).
* Behind it, an **Ingress Controller** manages routing (L7).

### Introduction

In this session, we revisited the **client-server model**, a foundational concept in network communication, to better understand how tools like `kubectl`, SSH, and TLS operate. We then explored **Public Key Cryptography (PKC)**—the backbone of secure authentication and communication in DevOps—focusing on SSH and HTTPS, and how tools like `ssh-keygen` and `openssl` help manage identity, encryption, and trust.

---

### Client and Server – A Refresher

![Alt text](/1-CKA-Certification-Course-2025/images/31-1.png)

A **client** is the one that initiates a request; the **server** is the one that responds.

**General Examples:**
* When **Seema** accesses `pinkbank.com`, **Seema** is the **client**, and **pinkbank.com** is the **server**.
* When **Varun** downloads something from his **S3 bucket**, **Varun** is the **client**, and the **S3 bucket** is the **server**.

**Kubernetes Examples:**
* When **Seema** use `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl` is the **client** and the **API server** is the **server**.
* When the API server talks to `etcd`, the API server is now the **client**, and `etcd` is the **server**.

This direction of communication is critical when we later talk about **client certificates** and **mTLS**.

## **Public Key Cryptography**

### **Public Key Cryptography in DevOps: Focus on SSH & HTTPS**  

![Alt text](/1-CKA-Certification-Course-2025/images/31-2.png)

Public Key Cryptography (PKC) underpins authentication and secure communication across multiple **application-layer protocols**. While it's used in **email security (PGP, S/MIME), VoIP, database connections, and secure messaging**, a **DevOps engineer primarily interacts with SSH and HTTPS** for managing infrastructure.

Two essential tools for handling public-private key pairs in these domains are **ssh-keygen** (for SSH authentication) and **openssl** (for TLS certificates).

---

#### **1. Secure Remote Access: `ssh-keygen` (SSH Authentication)**  

`ssh-keygen` is the primary tool for generating SSH **public/private key pairs**, which enable **secure remote login** without passwords.  

- Used for **server administration, Git authentication, CI/CD pipelines, and automation**.  
- The **private key** is kept on the **client**, while the **public key** is stored on the **server** (`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`).  
- Authentication works via **public key cryptography**, where the server **verifies the client’s signed request** using its **stored public key**.  

**Alternative SSH Key Tools:**  
- **PuTTYgen** → Windows-based tool for generating SSH keys (used with PuTTY).  
- **OpenSSH** → Built-in on most Unix-based systems, provides SSH utilities including key management.  
- **Mosh (Mobile Shell)** → Used for remote connections and can leverage SSH key authentication.  

---


#### **2. Secure Web Communication: `openssl` (TLS Certificates & Identity Validation)**  

`openssl` is widely used for **private key generation** and **certificate management**, conforming to the **X.509 standard** for TLS encryption.  

- Generates a **private key**, which is securely stored on the server.  
- Creates a **certificate**, which contains a **public key**, metadata (issuer, validity), and a **digital signature from a Certificate Authority (CA)**.  
- The **private key** is used to establish secure communication, while the certificate allows clients to verify the server’s identity.  

> **Note:** TLS is not exclusive to HTTPS. Other application-layer protocols, such as **SMTP** (for email), **FTPS** (for secure file transfer), and **IMAPS** (for secure email retrieval), also use TLS for authentication and secure communication.

**Alternative TLS Certificate Tools:**

* **CFSSL (Cloudflare’s PKI Toolkit)** → Go-based toolkit by Cloudflare for generating and signing certificates.
* **HashiCorp Vault** → 	Can issue, sign, and manage certificates securely.
* **Certbot** → Automates key + cert generation from Let's Encrypt.

**Why TLS Still Uses a Tool Named "OpenSSL"**

At first glance, it may seem ironic that **TLS certificates are still generated using a tool called *OpenSSL***, especially since **SSL is obsolete** and has been replaced by TLS. But there's a historical and practical reason behind it.

**OpenSSL** originated as a toolkit to implement **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**, the predecessor to TLS. As SSL was deprecated and TLS became the standard, OpenSSL evolved to support all modern versions of **TLS** (including TLS 1.3), while keeping its original name for compatibility and familiarity.

But **OpenSSL is much more than just a certificate generator**. It’s a comprehensive **cryptographic toolkit** that can:

* Generate public/private key pairs
* Create and sign X.509 certificates
* Perform encryption, decryption, and hashing
* Handle PKI-related formats like PEM, DER, PKCS#12
* Test and debug secure sockets using TLS

So while the name "OpenSSL" may sound outdated, the tool itself is **modern, versatile, and still central** to secure communications today.

---

#### **Key Management Best Practices**  

To protect private keys from unauthorized access, consider these secure storage options:  

- **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)** → Dedicated devices for key protection.  
- **Secure Enclaves (TPM, Apple Secure Enclave)** → Isolated hardware environments restricting key access.  
- **Cloud-based KMS (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault)** → Encrypted storage with controlled access.  
- **Encrypted Key Files (`.pem`, `.pfx`)** → Secured with strong passwords.  
- **Smart Cards & USB Tokens (YubiKey, Nitrokey)** → Portable hardware-based security.  
- **Air-Gapped Systems** → Completely offline key storage to prevent network attacks.  

Regular **key rotation** and **audits** are crucial to maintaining security and replacing compromised keys efficiently. 

#### **Common Key File Formats**

#### **For SSH Authentication**

| Format                                | Description                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `.pub`                                | **Public key** (shared with the remote server)      |
| `.key`, `*-key.pem`, **no extension** | **Private key** (must be kept secure on the client) |




#### **For TLS Certificates**

| Format              | Description                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.crt`, `.pem`      | **Certificate** (contains a public key and metadata)            |
| `.key`, `*-key.pem`, **no extension**  | **Private key** (must be securely stored)                       |
| `.csr`              | **Certificate Signing Request** (used to request a signed cert) |

By properly managing key storage and implementing best practices, organizations can significantly reduce security risks and prevent unauthorized access.

---

#### **What Public Key Cryptography (PKC) Provides**

Public Key Cryptography (PKC) underpins secure communication by enabling:
- Authentication (Identity Verification)
- Secure Key Exchange (Foundation for Encryption)

We will now discuss both of these in details.

### 1. **Authentication (Identity Verification):**

Public Key Cryptography enables entities—**users, servers, or systems**—to prove their identity using **key pairs** and **digital signatures**. This is fundamental to ensuring that communication is happening with a legitimate party.

#### **In SSH:**

![Alt text](/1-CKA-Certification-Course-2025/images/31-3.png)

SSH supports **mutual authentication**, where:

* **Server Authentication (Host Key):**

  * When an SSH server (e.g., a Linux machine) is installed, it automatically generates a **host key pair** for each supported algorithm (like RSA, ECDSA, ED25519), stored at:

    * **Private Key:** `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_<algo>_key`
    * **Public Key:** `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_<algo>_key.pub`

  * These keys are used to **prove the identity of the server** to any connecting SSH client.

  * When a client connects:

    * The server sends its **host public key**.

    * The SSH client checks whether this key is already present in its **`~/.ssh/known_hosts`** file.

  * If it's the **first connection**, the key won't exist in `known_hosts`, and the client will show a prompt:

    ```
    The authenticity of host 'server.com (192.168.1.10)' can't be established.
    ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:abc123...
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
    ```

    You can manually verify the fingerprint by running the following command **on the server** to print the fingerprint of its public host key:

    ```
    ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
    ```

    * `-l` (lowercase L): shows the fingerprint of the key.
    * `-f`: specifies the path to the public key file.

    Replace `ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub` with the appropriate public key file (e.g., for RSA: `ssh_host_rsa_key.pub`) if using a different algorithm.


    * If the user accepts (`yes`), the server's host key is **saved in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`** and used for verification in all future connections.

    * This approach is called **TOFU (Trust On First Use)**—you trust the server the first time, and ensure its identity doesn't change later.
    * Host Key Verification Methods:

      1. **TOFU (Trust On First Use)**
        Accept the host key manually when prompted during the first connection. Risky on untrusted networks.

      2. **Phone-a-Friend**
        Contact someone who already has access to the server and confirm the server's fingerprint via a secure channel.

      3. **OOB (Out-of-Band) Verification**
        Compare the fingerprint out-of-band (e.g., via Slack, secure email, a trusted documentation portal, etc.).

      4. **Ansible or Configuration Management**
        Use automation tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef to push known host fingerprints into `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

      5. **Pre-loading Known Hosts**
        Populate the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` or `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts` file manually with the correct public key before connecting:

        ```bash
        ssh-keyscan server.example.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
        ```

      6. **Centralized Trust Models**
        In enterprises, SSH certificates (using OpenSSH's CA support) can be used where a trusted internal CA signs host keys and clients trust the CA.

  * On subsequent connections:

    * If the server's host key has changed (possibly due to a reinstallation or a **man-in-the-middle attack**), SSH will warn the user and may block the connection unless the mismatch is explicitly resolved.

    * This warning may also appear in **cloud environments** where the server’s **ephemeral public IP** changes — even if the host key is the same — because SSH uses the IP/hostname to identify the server.

  * To copy public key to the server
    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id #append public key to authorized key file
    ```

* **Client Authentication:**

  * The **server sends a challenge**, and the **client must sign it using its private key** (e.g., `~/.ssh/mykey`) to prove it possesses the corresponding private key.
  * The **server verifies the signature** using the **client’s public key**, which must be present in the server’s `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

#### **In TLS (e.g., HTTPS):**

* The server presents a **digital certificate** (issued and signed by a **trusted Certificate Authority**) to the client.
* This certificate includes the server’s **public key** and a **CA signature**.
* The client verifies:
  * That the certificate is **issued by a trusted CA** (whose root cert is pre-installed).
  * That the certificate matches the **domain name** (e.g., `example.com`).
* Optionally, in **mutual TLS**, the client also presents a certificate for authentication.

---

### Order of Authentication in Mutual Authentication (SSH or mTLS)

Whether using **SSH** or **mutual TLS (mTLS)**, the **server always authenticates first**, followed by the client.

**Reasons the server authenticates first:**

* The client must verify the server's identity before sending any sensitive data.
* It prevents man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by ensuring the connection is to the intended endpoint.
* A secure, encrypted channel is established only after the server is trusted.
* This pattern ensures that secrets (like private keys or credentials) are never exposed to an untrusted server.

This sequence holds true for:

* SSH (server presents host key first, then client authentication occurs)
* mTLS (server presents its certificate first, then requests the client's certificate if required)

---

### 2. **Secure Key Exchange (Foundation for Encryption):**

Rather than encrypting all data directly using asymmetric cryptography, **Public Key Cryptography (PKC)** is used to **securely exchange or derive symmetric session keys**. These **session keys** are then used for efficient **symmetric encryption** of actual data in transit.

* In **SSH**:

  * Both the **client and server participate equally** in a **key exchange algorithm** (e.g., **Diffie-Hellman** or **ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)**).
  * Each side contributes a random component and uses the other’s public part to **jointly compute the same session key**.
  * **No single party creates the session key outright**; it is derived **collaboratively**, ensuring that **neither side sends the session key directly** — making it secure even over untrusted networks.
  * >🔐 **Importantly, this session key is established and encryption begins *before* any client authentication takes place.**
    This ensures that even authentication credentials (like passwords or signed challenges) are never sent in plaintext.

* In **TLS**:

  * **Older TLS (e.g., TLS 1.2 with RSA key exchange)**
![Alt text](/1-CKA-Certification-Course-2025/images/31-8.png)
    * The client generates a session key.
    * It encrypts the session key using the server’s public key (from its certificate).
    * The server decrypts it using its private key.
    * Both sides use this session key for symmetric encryption.
      **Drawback**: If the server’s private key is compromised, past sessions can be decrypted (no forward secrecy).

  * **Modern TLS (e.g., TLS 1.3 or TLS 1.2 with ECDHE)**
![Alt text](/1-CKA-Certification-Course-2025/images/31-4.png)
    * The client and server perform an ephemeral key exchange (e.g., ECDHE – Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral).
    * Both sides derive the session key collaboratively — it is never transmitted directly.
      **Advantage**: Even if the server’s private key is compromised later, past communications remain secure (forward secrecy).

In production environments, it is critical to secure private keys using FIPS 140-2 compliant Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). FIPS 140-2 defines multiple levels of compliance, with higher levels offering stricter physical and logical security controls. Organizations may opt for cloud-based HSMs (like AWS CloudHSM, Azure Key Vault, or GCP Cloud HSM), which are typically FIPS 140-2 Level 2 compliant, balancing strong security with scalability and manageability.

> * **In SSH, encryption begins *before* authentication**, ensuring that even credentials are exchanged over a secure channel.
>* **In HTTPS (TLS), authentication happens *before* encryption**, as the server must first prove its identity via certificate.

Since session keys derived using ECDHE are ephemeral, a new key pair is generated by both the client and server for each new session. The resulting session key is unique to that connection and is discarded once the session ends.

---

### Types of TLS Certificate Authorities (CA): Public, Private, and Self-Signed

When enabling HTTPS or TLS for applications, certificates must be signed to be trusted by clients. There are three common ways to achieve this:
1. **Public CA** – Used for production websites accessible over the internet (e.g., Let's Encrypt, DigiCert).
2. **Private CA** – Used within organizations for internal services (e.g., `*.internal` domains).
3. **Self-Signed Certificates** – Quick to create, mainly used for testing, but not trusted by browsers.

**Public CA vs Private CA vs Self-Signed Certificates**

| **Certificate Type**         | **Use Case**                                      | **Trust Level**                 | **Common Examples**                       | **Typical Use**                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public CA**                | Production websites, accessible over the internet | Trusted by all major browsers   | Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, GlobalSign       | Used for production environments and public-facing sites                               |
| **Private CA**               | Internal services within an organization          | Trusted within the organization | Custom CA (e.g., internal enterprise CAs) | Used for internal applications, such as `*.internal` domains                           |
| **Self-Signed Certificates** | Testing and development                           | Not trusted by browsers         | N/A                                       | Quick certificates for testing or development purposes, not recommended for production |

---

### Public CA

![Alt text](/1-CKA-Certification-Course-2025/images/31-5.png)

When you visit a website like `pinkbank.com`, your browser needs a way to verify that the server it’s talking to is indeed `pinkbank.com` and not someone pretending to be it. That’s where a **Certificate Authority (CA)** comes into play.

* `pinkbank.com` generates its own digital certificate (often through a **Certificate Signing Request** using tools like OpenSSL) and then gets it signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) such as Let’s Encrypt to prove its authenticity.
* Seema’s browser, like most browsers, already contains the **public keys of well-known CAs**. So, it can verify that the certificate presented by `pinkbank.com` is indeed signed by Let’s Encrypt.
* This trust chain ensures authenticity. Without a CA, there would be no trusted way to confirm the server’s identity.

If a certificate were self-signed or signed by an unknown entity, Seema’s browser would show a warning because it cannot validate the certificate's authenticity.

**Important Note**
In this example, I used Let’s Encrypt because it is a popular choice for DevOps engineers, developers, and cloud engineers, as it provides free, automated SSL/TLS certificates.
> While Let’s Encrypt is widely used even in production environments, especially for public-facing services, enterprise use cases may also involve certificates from commercial Certificate Authorities (CAs) like DigiCert, GlobalSign, Entrust, or Google Trust Services — which offer advanced features like extended validation (EV), organization validation (OV), SLAs, and dedicated support.

---

**Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**

PKI is a framework that manages digital certificates, keys, and Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) to enable secure communication over networks. It involves the use of **public and private keys** to encrypt and decrypt data, ensuring confidentiality and authentication.

---

### Private CA

![Alt text](/1-CKA-Certification-Course-2025/images/31-6.png)

Just like browsers come with a list of trusted CAs, you can manually add a CA’s public key to your trust store (e.g., in a browser or an operating system).

**Summary for Internal HTTPS Access Without Warnings**

To securely expose an internal app as `https://app1.internal` without browser warnings:

* Set up a **private Certificate Authority (CA)** and issue a TLS certificate for `app1.internal`.

* Install the **private CA’s root certificate** on all internal user machines so their browsers trust the certificate:

  * **Windows**: Use **Group Policy (GPO)** to add the CA cert to the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** store.
  * **macOS**: Use **MDM** or manually import the root cert using **Keychain Access** → System → Certificates → Trust.
  * **Linux**: Place the CA cert in `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` and run:

    ```bash
    sudo update-ca-certificates
    ```

* Ensure internal DNS resolves `app1.internal` to the correct internal IP.

---

### Self-Signed Certificate

![Alt text](/1-CKA-Certification-Course-2025/images/31-7.png)

A **self-signed certificate** is a certificate that is **signed with its own private key**, rather than being issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

Let’s take an example:
Our developer **Shwetangi** is building an internal application named **app2**, accessible locally at **app2.test**. She wants to enable **HTTPS** to test how her application behaves over a secure connection. Since it's only for development, she generates a self-signed certificate using tools like `openssl` and uses it to enable HTTPS on **app2.test**.

#### **Typical Use Cases of Self-Signed Certificates**

* Local development and testing environments
* Internal tools not exposed publicly
* Quick prototyping or sandbox setups
* Lab or non-production Kubernetes clusters

> ⚠️ Self-signed certificates are **not trusted by browsers or clients** by default and will trigger warnings like:
> Chrome: “Your connection is not private” (NET::ERR\_CERT\_AUTHORITY\_INVALID)
> Firefox: “Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead”

#### **Common Internal Domain Suffixes for Testing**

* `.test` — Reserved for testing and documentation (RFC 6761)
* `.local` — Often used by mDNS/Bonjour or local network devices
* `.internal` — Used in private networks or cloud-native environments (e.g., GCP)
* `.dev`, `.example` — Reserved for documentation and sometimes local use

Using these reserved domains helps avoid accidental DNS resolution on the public internet and is a best practice for local/dev setups.

---

### **Conclusion**

Public Key Cryptography enables secure remote access, identity verification, and encrypted communication—essentials in modern infrastructure. From SSH keys to TLS certificates, understanding the flow of trust and proper key management is critical for any DevOps engineer. This foundation sets the stage for deeper topics like **mutual TLS**, **client certificates**, and **PKI systems** in production environments.

Got it 👍 — you want a **detailed explanation of that entire SSH key exchange and authentication process** (from your provided lecture-style notes).
Here’s the **full, structured breakdown** — simplified yet complete — explaining what’s going on in each part of that process:

---

# 🔐 SSH Key Exchange and Authentication — Full Explanation

---

## 🧩 Step 0: Understanding the Basics

Before a secure SSH connection can happen, two key things must be true:

1. **Client (Sema)** and **Server (Ubuntu VM)** must **authenticate each other**.

   * Client = the one initiating SSH (`ssh user@server`)
   * Server = the one accepting SSH connections

2. **All communication must be encrypted** so no one can read or modify data in transit.

---

## 🧠 Step 1: Key Pair — Public and Private Keys

* Sema (the client) has:

  * A **private key** — kept secret and never leaves her machine.
  * A **public key** — can be safely shared.

The **server stores** a copy of Sema’s **public key** (in `/home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys`).

So when Sema connects:

* Her private key stays with her.
* The public key is already on the server.

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: SSH Connection Initiation

When Sema runs:

```bash
ssh sema@ubuntu-server
```

→ The SSH handshake begins.

And here’s the important part:

> 🔒 Encryption happens **right at the start** — even before authentication.

That means all authentication information (passwords, keys, etc.) is sent **inside an encrypted tunnel**.

---

## 🔄 Step 3: Session Key Creation (Encryption Setup)

At the beginning, both sides (Sema and server) **jointly create a session key** — a **temporary symmetric key** used for this connection only.

### 🔹 What is a session key?

A **symmetric key** that both client and server use:

* One key for both encryption and decryption.
* Faster and lighter than asymmetric encryption.

Example:

```
Sema encrypts data → Server decrypts using same session key.
Server encrypts → Sema decrypts with same key.
```

---

## 🧮 Step 4: How the Session Key Is Generated

Now comes the smart part — **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DH or ECDH)**.

### How it works:

1. Both sides generate **temporary (ephemeral)** key pairs.
2. They exchange **only the public parts**.
3. Each side uses **its private key + the other’s public key** to calculate a **shared secret**.
4. That shared secret mathematically results in the **same session key** on both ends.

➡️ Neither side ever **sends** the session key over the network.
➡️ It’s derived independently using math — this is the **“magic” of Diffie-Hellman**.

So:

* **Sema’s private ephemeral key** + **Server’s public ephemeral key** = session key
* **Server’s private ephemeral key** + **Sema’s public ephemeral key** = same session key

Thus:

> 🧠 The session key is the same on both sides — without ever being transmitted.

---

## 🧱 Step 5: Encryption Tunnel Established

Once that session key is created:

* A secure encrypted tunnel is formed between Sema and the server.
* From now on, **all communication**, including authentication, happens securely inside this tunnel.

So now:

> Even if someone intercepts packets, they see only encrypted data — not usernames, passwords, or keys.

---

## 🧾 Step 6: Server Authentication

Now that the channel is encrypted, the **client must verify that the server is genuine** (not an attacker).

How?

* The server presents its **public host key fingerprint** to Sema.

The fingerprint is a short unique hash (like a digital signature) of the server’s public key.

Example prompt Sema might see:

```
The authenticity of host 'ubuntu-server (10.0.0.1)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:AbCdEfGh...
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

---

## 🧾 Step 7: Host Key Verification (Server Trust Methods)

Sema now has to decide: *Do I trust this server’s fingerprint?*
Here are all the ways she can verify it:

### 1. **Trust on First Use (TOFU)**

* Sema accepts the fingerprint once manually (presses “yes”).
* SSH saves the server’s public key in:

  ```
  ~/.ssh/known_hosts
  ```
* Future connections check against this file.

### 2. **Phone a Friend**

* Sema asks a colleague who already has SSH access to verify the fingerprint on the actual server.

### 3. **Out-of-Band Verification**

* Sema logs into the VM via console or cloud dashboard and checks the server’s fingerprint directly.

### 4. **Ansible Automation**

* Using Ansible, the admin can **preload the known host fingerprints** for all servers.
* Then, when Sema connects, she won’t see the “unknown host” prompt.

### 5. **Manual Preload**

* Sema can manually add a server’s public key and fingerprint to her `known_hosts` file before connecting.

### 6. **Centralized Trust Model (Enterprise)**

* In large organizations, a **Certificate Authority (CA)** verifies server identities using SSH certificates.

---

## 🧩 Step 8: Client Authentication (After Server Trust)

Once Sema trusts the server, now **the server must verify Sema**.

* The server checks whether Sema’s **public key** is in its `authorized_keys` file.
* If yes:

  1. The server sends a **challenge** (a random string).
  2. Sema’s SSH client encrypts that challenge with her **private key**.
  3. The server decrypts it with Sema’s **public key**.
  4. If it matches → authentication succeeds.

✅ Sema is authenticated.

---

## 🔐 Step 9: Secure Communication

At this point:

* Both sides are authenticated.
* The tunnel is encrypted with the **session key**.
* Data flows securely in both directions.

Even if someone captures the traffic, they **cannot decrypt it**, because:

* The session key was never sent.
* The private keys are never shared.

---

## 🔁 Step 10: Subsequent Connections

Next time Sema connects:

* SSH finds the server’s fingerprint already stored in `known_hosts`.
* No verification prompt appears unless:

  * The server’s key changes (e.g., reinstalled or compromised).

Then SSH warns:

```
WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!
```

This prevents **man-in-the-middle attacks**.

| Concept                     | Description                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Public/Private Key Pair** | Used for identity verification                |
| **Session Key**             | Symmetric key for encrypting SSH session      |
| **Diffie-Hellman / ECDH**   | Algorithm to derive a shared session key      |
| **Ephemeral Keys**          | Temporary keys used only during session setup |
| **Known Hosts File**        | Stores trusted server fingerprints            |
| **Authorized Keys File**    | Stores authorized client public keys          |
| **Host Key Verification**   | Ensures the server is genuine                 |
| **Encryption Start Point**  | Happens before authentication (Step 1)        |

## 🔒 Security Summary

| Security Property   | How It’s Ensured                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Confidentiality** | Session key encryption (symmetric)          |
| **Integrity**       | Encrypted tunnel (tamper-proof)             |
| **Authentication**  | Public-private key challenge                |
| **Non-repudiation** | Keys uniquely tied to users                 |
| **Key Secrecy**     | Private key never leaves the owner’s system |

---

### 🧩 Final Takeaway

> * Private keys never leave the system.
> * Session keys are never transmitted.
> * Encryption starts before authentication.
> * Both client and server authenticate each other.
> * Diffie-Hellman ensures secure key exchange without exposure.

Would you like me to add a **diagram or flowchart** showing each step visually (from connection → key exchange → authentication → encrypted communication)? It helps a lot to visualize SSH handshake flow.


Perfect — that transcript is a *complete explanation* of **Public**, **Private**, and **Self-Signed Certificates** under the umbrella of **Certificate Authorities (CAs)**.
Here’s a **clear, summarized, and structured version** so you can use it for notes or interview prep 👇

---

## 🔐 Understanding Certificate Authorities (CAs)

CAs are part of **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**, which includes:

* Digital Certificates
* Public/Private Key Pairs
* Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs)
* Certificate Authorities (CA)

---

### 🏛️ 1. Public Certificate Authority (Public CA)

**Definition:**
A trusted, third-party organization that issues digital certificates for public-facing websites.

**Examples:** DigiCert, Sectigo, Verisign, Let’s Encrypt

**Key Points:**

* ✅ Used in **production environments** and **public websites** (e.g., `https://google.com`)
* 🌍 **Trusted by all major browsers and operating systems**
* 🧾 Must comply with strict standards (WebTrust, CA/Browser Forum)
* 🏗️ Operates under **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** — involving keys, CSRs, and digital signatures
* ⚙️ Certificates issued by them are automatically trusted; no manual setup needed

**Use Cases:**

* E-commerce websites
* Banking portals
* Public APIs or SaaS services

---

### 🏢 2. Private Certificate Authority (Private CA)

**Definition:**
A CA managed **internally** by an organization for **internal or restricted use**.

**Examples:**
OpenSSL, HashiCorp Vault, Smallstep CA, AWS Private CA, Cloudflare SSL

**Key Points:**

* 🔒 Used for **internal apps**, **intranets**, **Kubernetes**, **service meshes**
* 🚫 **Not trusted by browsers by default**
* 🧰 To make it trusted, add the CA’s root certificate to all systems’ or browsers’ **trust store**
* ⚙️ Automate distribution using:

  * **Windows:** Group Policy
  * **macOS:** MDM
  * **Linux:** Copy certs to `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/` or similar via Ansible

**Use Cases:**

* Internal company dashboards (`app1.internal`)
* DevOps services (Jenkins, GitLab internal)
* Kubernetes components (etcd, kubelet, API server)
* Internal HTTPS communication

**Advantages:**

* Full control over issuance & revocation
* No dependency on public internet
* Cost-effective for internal use

---

### 👨‍💻 3. Self-Signed Certificates

**Definition:**
A certificate **signed by its own private key**, not by any CA.

**Key Points:**

* 🧪 **Used only for development or testing**
* ⚠️ **Browsers show warnings** like “Connection is not private”
* 🕒 Quick and simple to generate (using `openssl` or `mkcert`)
* 🚫 Not suitable for production

**Use Cases:**

* Local testing (e.g., `app.test`, `localhost`)
* Developer sandbox environments

**Example command:**

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
```

### 🧩 Summary Table

| Type            | Trusted by Browsers           | Typical Use         | Example Tools           | Example Use Case       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Public CA**   | ✅ Yes                         | Public-facing sites | DigiCert, Let’s Encrypt | `https://example.com`  |
| **Private CA**  | 🚫 No (unless manually added) | Internal networks   | OpenSSL, Vault          | `https://app.internal` |
| **Self-Signed** | 🚫 No                         | Local testing       | OpenSSL, mkcert         | `https://localhost`    |

---

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

* **Public CA** → Production, internet-facing, globally trusted
* **Private CA** → Internal org security, manual trust required
* **Self-Signed** → Development/testing only
* **All are part of PKI**, but differ in **trust scope** and **usage**

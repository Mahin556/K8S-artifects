## Difference Between Docker Secrets and Kubernetes Secrets

Both **Docker Secrets** and **Kubernetes Secrets** are mechanisms to securely store sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and certificates, but they differ in how they operate and their default security features.

| Feature                  | Docker Secrets                                          | Kubernetes Secrets                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Platform**             | Works with **Docker Swarm** and **Docker Compose**      | Works with **Kubernetes clusters**                                                         |
| **Purpose**              | Store and manage sensitive data for containers          | Store and manage sensitive data for pods and containers                                    |
| **Encryption at Rest**   | **Encrypted by default**                                | **Not encrypted by default**; must enable encryption at rest manually in etcd              |
| **Access Control**       | Only available to services that explicitly request them | Access controlled via **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control)                                 |
| **Usage**                | Injected as **files inside containers**                 | Injected as **environment variables**, **mounted volumes**, or **files inside containers** |
| **Lifecycle Management** | Automatically managed by Docker Swarm                   | Managed via Kubernetes API; can be updated, replaced, or deleted                           |
| **Integration**          | Works natively with Docker services and stacks          | Works natively with Kubernetes workloads (Deployments, Pods, StatefulSets, etc.)           |

### Key Takeaways

* Both Docker Secrets and Kubernetes Secrets serve the same **purpose of securely managing sensitive data**.
* The **biggest difference** is **encryption at rest**: Docker encrypts secrets automatically, whereas Kubernetes requires manual encryption configuration.
* Kubernetes offers more **fine-grained access control** via RBAC and integrates with a wider ecosystem of tools for secret management.

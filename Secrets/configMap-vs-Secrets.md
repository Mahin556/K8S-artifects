| **Feature**                    | **Kubernetes Secrets**                                                                                                                        | **Kubernetes ConfigMaps**                                                                                                   |

| **Purpose / Data Sensitivity** | Used for storing **sensitive data** such as passwords, tokens, SSH keys, and certificates.                                                    | Used for storing **non-sensitive configuration data** such as application settings, environment variables, or config files. |
| **Data Encoding**              | Data is stored **Base64-encoded**, providing minimal obfuscation (not encryption).                                                            | Data is stored in **plain text** without any encoding or encryption.                                                        |
| **Access Control**             | Supports **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** for fine-grained permission management on who can view or modify secrets.                       | Access control is limited to **namespace-level**, with less granularity.                                                    |
| **Use Cases**                  | Best suited for **confidential information** that should not be visible in plain text — e.g., API keys, database passwords, TLS certificates. | Ideal for **application configuration data** that can safely be exposed to Pods — e.g., app parameters, file paths, URLs.   |
| **Data Storage**               | Stored **securely within the Kubernetes cluster**, optionally encrypted at rest in `etcd`.                                                    | Stored in **etcd** alongside other Kubernetes resources (not encrypted by default).                                         |
| **Mounting / Access**          | Mounted as **files or environment variables** in Pods that need them.                                                                         | Also mounted as **files or environment variables**, but without sensitive data considerations.                              |

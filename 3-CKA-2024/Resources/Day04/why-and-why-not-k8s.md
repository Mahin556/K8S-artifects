### ✅ **5 Use Cases Where You SHOULD Use Kubernetes**

* **Microservices Architecture**
  When you have many small, independent services that need to scale, communicate, and be updated independently.
* **High Availability & Auto-healing**
  If your apps must always stay online, K8s ensures failed pods are rescheduled automatically and traffic shifts to healthy ones.
* **Dynamic Scaling Needs**
  Apps with unpredictable workloads (e.g., e-commerce, streaming, gaming) benefit from Kubernetes’ horizontal pod autoscaling.
* **Hybrid/Multi-Cloud Deployments**
  If you need to run workloads across AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-prem, Kubernetes gives you portability and consistency.
* **CI/CD Pipelines & Frequent Deployments**
  Ideal when development teams push updates multiple times a day, since rolling updates and rollbacks are built-in.

### ❌ **5 Use Cases Where You SHOULDN’T Use Kubernetes**

* **Small, Simple Applications**
  A personal project, static website, or small internal tool doesn’t need Kubernetes overhead; Docker Compose is enough.
* **Low Infrastructure Resources**
  Kubernetes control plane and nodes require memory/CPU — overkill for resource-constrained environments.
* **Teams Without DevOps Expertise**
  If your team lacks Kubernetes and cloud-native skills, managing clusters may slow you down instead of helping.
* **Stateful Apps Without Need for Scaling**
  For a single-instance database or app that won’t scale horizontally, K8s adds unnecessary complexity.
* **Short-Term or One-Off Projects**
  If the app will run for just a few weeks/months, setting up Kubernetes is wasted effort — simpler deployment methods are better.

## What is Docker

## Understanding Containers V/S Virtual Machines

- Container are light weigth alternative of VMs
- Hyperviser allow to run multiple VM on a single physical host.
- Container engine allow to run multiple containers on a Virtual or physical host.

## Containers V/S Virtual machines with the help of a Building and House analogy

- Container have a shared infra(H/W resources and OS), on Physical server or VM can run a multiple instance of same application.
- Vm also used share resource but not OS, only run a single instance of application.
- Binaries and dependencies can be used by different application inn VM but in container the binaries and dependencies can only used by the application in container.
- Container user infra more efficiently and use optimally

## Challenges with the non-containerized applications(traditionally)

- Application and there code is seperate and also deployed and configured separately, due to this there can be environment inconsistency.
- So application can work on some environment or can't work on some environment due to this inconsistency.
  
## How Docker solves the challenges

## That's how docker was born(Just kidding!)

## A Simple Docker WorkFlow

- Developer write a dockerfile in organizations, devops engineer help to write a docker file.
- Dovops engineer need to know how to write a docker file.
- Starting point in docker workflow
- Registry is like VCS for docker image like git&github for source code.
- Dockerhub is the registry for public images which is desined to store the docker images.
- Docker endorse hub.docker.io
